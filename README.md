## Features

- **Dynamic Height Calculation**: Utilizes the `calc()` function to calculate the remaining height of the midsection after subtracting 200px (100px for the navbar and 100px for the footer). This ensures optimal use of available screen space.

- **Color-Schema** Harness the power of customizable colors with predefined `primary` and `secondary` color variables, allowing effortless and `uniform color` adjustments across components.

- **Fluid Responsive Design**: Ensures that the image displayed in the app does not stretch or distort across different screen sizes.

- **Viewport Size Optimization**: The application's size is always equal to the viewport size, maintaining consistency and preventing unnecessary scrolling.

- **Overlay for Translucency**: Utilizes an overlay with CSS to create a `translucent effect`, enhancing the visual appeal of certain sections of the app. The overlay is strategically positioned to bring translucency while maintaining readability of the content.

- **Responsive Layout**: Implements responsive design principles to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used for creating the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS:** Employed for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website.
